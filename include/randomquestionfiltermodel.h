This class should be installed on a source model with the following columns:
    0 - id  INTEGER
    1 - askedQuestion TEXT

    3 - answer2 TEXT
    4 - answer3 TEXT
    5 - answer4 TEXT

The function generateRandomQuestions(int count) selects n random rows from the
source model and forwards them to RandomQuestionFilterModel.
Then from QML only the random selected entries are visible.
