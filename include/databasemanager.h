/*
This class allows changing the questions databases at runtime.

Therefore it holds references to all models connecting to the database with
the questions:

QuestionSqlTableModel:
-> takes the database connection directly as its data source.

QuestionsProxyModel:
-> Uses QuestionSqlTableModel as a source of data. Its used as an adapter
to map the Qt Widget table access (access by column numbers) to the
QML Table acces scheme (Access by user defined roles).

RandomQuestionFilterModel:
-> Uses QuestionsProxyModel as its source of data and filters to only provide
n random questions.

So in short the data is forwarded like this:
Database -> QuestionSqlTableModel -> QuestionsProxyModel ->
RandomQuestionFilterModel

The current database can be changed with the function
changeDatabaseConnection(). Since QuestionSqlTableModel database cannot be
changed at runtime the model is replaced with a new instance. Then
QuestionsProxyModel changes it data source to the new instance of
QuestionsProxyModel.
